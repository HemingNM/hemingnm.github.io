The species is currently threatened by habitat loss and has been classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2015. We used ecological niche models built with MaxEnt to predict the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of this species. The models were projected onto the reference climate, considering six climate scenarios (three GCMs and two RCPs) from IPCC for 2050 and 2070. We showed that while the amount of suitable area is expected to change little across the species’ range in most evaluated climate scenarios, climatic conditions may significantly deteriorate by 2070 in the pessimistic scenario, especially in currently warmer and dryer areas to the west. As seen on other capuchin monkeys, the potential use of tools by crested capuchins may increase the chances of the species adaptation to novel harsher environmental conditions. The major negative impacts across the species range also include habitat loss and fragmentation so that the conservation of the species relies on the protection of the forest remnants in the center of its distribution, which can harbor populations of the species in current and future climate scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Conservation of the Endangered Crested Capuchin Monkey ({\u001bmph{Sapajus robustus}}) Under Climate Change and Habitat Loss","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Flavio M.

Nevertheless, a dramatic change in land use occurred throughout the entire RDB after the turn of the 19 th century. Currently, the RDB is one of the most degraded regions in southeastern Brazil and, recently, it was the scenario of the worst environmental disaster in Brazilian history. In this series of papers, we aim to construct a baseline biodiversity assessment that documents the changes in bird communities within the RDB throughout the last two centuries. In this first part, we present the history of the RDB landscape, its explorers, and their collections based on an extensive literature review and museum data. Early biological surveys in the RDB only started at the beginning of the 19th century and were conducted mostly by German and French naturalists. During the first eight decades of ornithological exploration, foreign field naturalists conducted expeditions to the RDB and collected hundreds of bird specimens. Unfortunately, labelling and curatorial procedures were often poor and despite the prodigious efforts of those naturalists, results obtained were often meagre. The second phase of exploration occurred from the 1900s to the 1960s and was dominated by expeditions conducted by Brazilian natural history museums. During this phase, labelling and curatorial procedures improved considerably and the material collected significantly advanced our knowledge about the RDB avifauna The third phase occurred from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century, when collection of specimens decreased sharply and the research activity slowly shifted from museums to universities, with a focus on ecology and natural history. We are now in a fourth, more pluralistic phase, in which research continues to be done by universities, Brazilian natural history museums have resumed their collection activity, and birdwatching has emerged as a popular activity in Brazil, producing a tremendous amount of data in a short period of time.","tags":null,"title":"Two centuries of ornithological exploration of the Rio Doce basin, southeastern Brazil.

In Brazil, there is a lack of both historical and current tradition of establishing and curating egg collections. This paper provides information about the size of collections, collecting dates, major collectors, geographic locations, and institutions holding egg sets of Brazilian birds. Through this effort, we recovered part of the history of Brazilian ornithology and provide general directions for those interested in studying egg sets deposited in scientific collections. We retrieved information from 5,888 egg sets collected in Brazil between 1818‑2022, currently deposited at 45 institutions/museums. The four largest egg collections in Brazil are at MZUSP, MN, COMB and MPEG. However, around half of the egg sets are deposited in institutions from Europe (mainly at MLUH and ZMB in Germany, NMW in Austria, NHM in the UK, and CRRM in Romania) and the USA (mainly at the WFVZ). Most egg sets were collected between the 1890s and 1930s, and after 2010. In Brazil, 70% of the egg sets were collected in five Brazilian states (MG, SP, SC, PA, and RS). Overall, egg collecting was uneven in space and time. We traced ~ 330 egg collectors, but most egg sets were collected by José Caetano Guimarães Sobrinho, while Caio Guimarães Chagas was probably the greatest collection owner in Brazil. A recent increase in egg collecting shows a renewed interest in assembling this type of bird vouchers. A scientifically sustained, planned and ethical collection of eggs should continue in Brazil since the breeding biology of many species is still poorly known, and since egg sets are important to provide data for new studies on the ecology, evolution, and conservation of Brazilian birds.","tags":null,"title":"Oological collections and egg collectors of Brazilian birds: an overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Phylogenetic indices (such as phylogenetic diversity (Faith 1992), phylogenetic endemism (Rosauer et al. 2009), and weighted endemism (Laffan et al., 2016)) for presence-absence rasters.\n","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"912f1d4ff25426c4b1107f91e41f4981","permalink":"https://hemingnm.github.io/software/phyloraster/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/phyloraster/","section":"software","summary":"Phylogenetic indices (such as phylogenetic diversity (Faith 1992), phylogenetic endemism (Rosauer et al. 2009), and weighted endemism (Laffan et al., 2016)) for presence-absence rasters.","tags":["evolutionary","spatial"],"title":"phyloraster: Evolutionary Diversity Metrics for Raster Data","type":"software"},{"authors":["Julio A.

Os impactos conhecidos desta ameaça incluem mudanças na área de distribuição das espécies, reestruturação das comunidades, mudanças fenológicas e, em casos mais extremos, a extinção de espécies que não podem migrar ou se adaptar a novas condições ambientais. Devido à tendência latitudinal de maior riqueza nos trópicos, esta região é propensa a apresentar as maiores taxas de perda de espécies no futuro. Portanto, prever as consequências das mudanças climáticas e as áreas que provavelmente serão mais afetadas nos neotrópicos torna-se uma prioridade para a conservação.\nA eficácia da conservação da biodiversidade, no entanto, depende da preservação não apenas da riqueza taxonômica, mas também da diversidade de linhagens. Os anfíbios são um excelente grupo para abordar essas questões, visto que a maioria das espécies apresenta alta dependência de condições climáticas e limitada capacidade de dispersão. Além disso, as estreitas especializações ecológicas e fisiológicas dos anfíbios os tornam um dos grupos mais sensíveis às mudanças climáticas.\nO objetivo deste projeto é avaliar como as mudanças climáticas futuras afetarão os padrões espaciais de riqueza e diversidade evolutiva de anuros neotropicais. Para isso, vamos modelar o nicho ecológico de cerca de 500 espécies de anuros para obter sua área de distribuição potencial no presente e no futuro (2050 e 2070), e então identificar os padrões espaciais de riqueza e diversidade evolutiva.

Some cacao pathogens are restricted to specific regions of the world, such as the                 Cacao swollen shoot virus                 (CSSV) in West African countries, while others are expanding geographically, such as                 Moniliophthora roreri                 in the Americas.                 M. roreri                 is one of the most threatening cacao pathogens since it directly attacks the cacao pods driving a significant reduction in production, and therefore economic losses. Despite its importance, the knowledge about the microenvironment of this pathogen and the cocoa pods is still poorly characterized.

Interestingly, the dynamics of microorganisms from different kingdoms varied proportionally, suggesting they are somehow affected by                 M. roreri                 culture time. We also identified three sequences similar to viral genomes from the                 Narnaviridae                 family, posteriorly confirmed by phylogenetic analysis as members of the genus                 Narnavirus                 . Screening of                 M. roreri                 public datasets indicated the virus sequences circulating in samples from Ecuador, suggesting a wide spread of these elements.

Although migratory status and climatic variables appear to be influencing intraspecific egg shape, these effects are not significant when accounting for nest identity as a random factor (i.e. eggs from the same clutch are more similar than to other clutches). Moreover, the differences that we observe in egg shape are not explained by variation in egg size. Finally, within a breeding population of migratory fork-tailed flycatchers, egg shape does not vary with respect to egg-laying order and/or female wing length (standardized by weight). Egg shape is highly variable within populations of fork-tailed flycatchers but not within clutches, suggesting that female traits, apart from migratory status and wing morphology, constrain egg shape variation.","tags":["behavioral strategies","clutch size","egg shape","latitudinal gradient","maternal effects","morphological evolution"],"title":"Egg shape variation across the distribution of the partially migratory fork‐tailed flycatcher {\u001bmph{Tyrannus savana}}","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Flavio Mariano Machado Mota","Neander M.

Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF.","tags":["avian","community structure","conservation strategies","diversity patterns","future scenarios","maxent","range shift","species distribution model"],"title":"Climate change is expected to restructure forest frugivorous bird communities in a biodiversity hot‐point within the Atlantic Forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriela Alves-Ferreira","Daniela C.

However, the biological and geographical traits that lead to these different responses remain poorly explored. Here, we evaluated how ecological and biogeographic traits influence amphibians’ response to climate change. We performed a systematic review searching for studies that evaluated the effects of future climate change on amphibian’s distribution. Our research returned 31 articles that projected the distribution of 331 amphibians. Our results demonstrate that species inhabiting an elevation above 515 m will lose a significant portion of their climatically suitable area. We also found that as isothermality increases, the amount of area suitable in response to climate change also increases. Another important discovery was that as the size of the baseline area increases, the greater must be the loss of climatically suitable areas. On the other hand, species with very small areas tend to keep their current climatically suitable area in the future. Furthermore, our results indicate that species that inhabit dry habitats tend to expand their suitable area in response to climate change. This result can be explained by the environmental characteristics of these habitats, which tend to present extreme seasonal climates with well-defined periods of drought and rain. We also found that anurans that inhabit exclusively forests are projected to lose a greater portion of their suitable areas, when compared to species that inhabit both forest and open areas, wetlands, and dry and rupestrian environments. The biogeographical realm also influenced anuran’s range shifts, with Afrotropic and Nearctic species projected to expand their geographical ranges. The assessment of climate change effects on amphibian distribution has been the focus of a growing number of studies. Despite this, some regions and species remain underrepresented. Current literature evaluates about 4% of the 7,477 species of Anura and 8% of the 773 species of Caudata and some regions rich in amphibian species remain severely underrepresented, such as Madagascar. Thus, future studies should focus on regions and taxas that remain underrepresented.","tags":null,"title":"Unraveling global impacts of climate change on amphibians distributions: A life-history and biogeographic-based approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Flavio Mariano Machado Mota","Neander M.

Future projections already indicate richness reduction and composition modifications of bird communities due to global warming, which may disrupt the provision of key ecological services to ecosystem maintenance. Here, we systematically review the effect of morphological, ecological, and geographical traits on the amount of future suitable area for birds worldwide. Specifically, we tested whether body mass, diet, habitat type, movement pattern, range size, and biogeographic realm affect birds' suitable area. Our search returned 75 studies that modeled the effects of climate change on 1,991 bird species. Our analyses included 1,661 species belonging to 128 families, representing 83% of the total, for which we were able to acquire all the six traits. The proportion of birds' suitable area was affected by range size, body mass, habitat type, and biogeographic realm, while diet and movement pattern showed lower relative importance and were not included in our final model. Contrary to expectations, the proportion of birds' suitable area was negatively related to range size, which may be explained by higher climatic stability predicted in certain areas that harbor species with restricted distribution. In contrast, we observed that birds presenting higher body mass will show an increase of the proportion of suitable area in the future. This is expected due to the high exposure of smaller birds to environmental changes and their difficulty to keep thermoregulation. Our results also indicated a low proportion of suitable area to forest-dependent birds, which is in accordance with their higher vulnerability due to specific requirements for reproduction and feeding. Finally, the proportion of suitable area was low for birds from Oceania, which is expected since the region encompasses small islands isolated from continents, preventing their species from reaching new suitable areas. Our study highlights that different traits should be considered when assessing extinction risk of species based on future projections, helping to improve bird conservation, especially the most vulnerable to climate change.","tags":null,"title":"Amount of bird suitable areas under climate change is modulated by morphological, ecological and geographical traits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neander M.

These agroforestry systems are gradually being replaced by unshaded cacao monocultures that might be more vulnerable to changes in climate; however, the impacts of climate change have not been evaluated yet. We assessed the impact of climate change on the climatic suitability of cacao plantations in southern Bahia and evaluated to what extent the cabrucas reduce the vulnerability of cacao as compared to unshaded plantations. We measured the maximum temperature in a gradient of canopy cover during the warmest month of the year and projected ecological niche models (MaxEnt) on climate projections for 2050 simulating the microclimate of three production systems: cabrucas, intermediate shading, and unshaded plantations. We found that canopy cover drastically reduces daily maximum temperature, so that understory temperature in cabrucas can be up to 6.0 °C lower than in unshaded plantations. We show for the first time that all projected environmental changes negatively affect cacao in southern Bahia, diminishing its climatic suitability and reducing overall suitable areas across the region. More importantly, this study is the first one to show that cabrucas can reduce the negative impacts of climate change for cacao, especially where temperature extremes approach or exceed crop tolerance limits. We conclude that maximizing short-term profits by implementing unshaded monocultures will likely lead to production losses in the long term. Cabrucas have a central role in reducing the vulnerability of cacao to climate change and since these traditional agroforestry systems cannot be quickly restored, their conservation should be an important goal of agricultural policies in the region.","tags":["Climate change adaptation","Climate-smart agriculture","Ecological niche model","Shaded plantations","Temperature stress","Theobroma cacao"],"title":"Cabruca agroforestry systems reduce vulnerability of cacao plantations to climate change in southern Bahia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clariana Lima Andre","Marina Correa Cortes","Neander M.

Studies have sought to understand how species occurrence vary according to habitat structure, space, food, predators, and competitors. Small mammals are widely used as a model system in community ecology, since they represent the most diverse group of mammals in the neotropical forests. Hence, we investigated whether microhabitat features, food resource (fruits), and presence of medium and large mammals can explain fine-spatial scale richness, abundances, and habitat use of small mammals in a forest in Brazil. Three species represented 83% of all captured individuals (Didelphis albiventris, Oligoryzomys nigripes, Akodon montensis). Species richness, abundance, and habitat use of small mammals were affected positively by the distance of bamboo (Chusquea sp.) thickets. The occurrence of predators (carnivores and omnivores) and potential competitors (large herbivores), however, did not affect richness, abundance, and habitat use of small mammals at small spatial scales. Our findings suggest that the bamboo patches can influence spatial distribution and shape small mammal communities in tropical forests.","tags":["Atlantic rainforest","Brazil","Caetetus Ecological Station","Chusquea","Community ecology","Grid method"],"title":"Bamboo shapes the fine-scale richness, abundance, and habitat use of small mammals in a forest fragment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriela Alves-Ferreira","Gaston Andres Fernandez Gine","Danilo de Siqueira Fortunato","Mirco Sole","Neander M.

However, due to narrow ecological and physiological tolerances, not all species are affected in the same way. Here, we test whether life history characteristics and biogeographic character influence the response of Cerrado anurans to climate change using ecological niche models. Our results demonstrate that a reduction in the potential distribution area is expected for most species in both optimistic (∼,70%) and pessimistic (∼,65%) emission scenarios. At first glance, this result might seem illogical, but when we assessed the magnitude of the losses, we found that even though more species lost area in the optimistic scenario, the amount of area lost was less than in the pessimistic scenario. Our findings also show that species that inhabit higher-altitude areas and the Western Cerrado will be more vulnerable to climate change. This shared “destination” in the face of climate change is associated with the sharing of some climate niche attributes among species in the same region, leading to similar responses. This data can be used to support biodiversity protection measures, such as the creation of a system of ecological corridors that allows the species tracking optimal climatic requirements in space.","tags":["Ecological niche modelling","Global warming","Life-history traits","Regional characteristics"],"title":"Projected responses of Cerrado anurans to climate change are mediated by biogeographic character","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neander M Heming"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Although some species became more abundant, the difference was not related to species diet. We did find a significant increase in the body weight of Euryoryzomys russatus after the bamboo blooming.

Using phylogeographic analyses of genome-wide SNPs (34,796 SNPs, 183 individuals) and ecological niche modeling, we inferred population structure, ploidy levels, admixture, and Pleistocene range dynamics of P. tremuloides, and tested several historical biogeographical hypotheses. We found three genetic lineages located mainly in coastal–Cascades (cluster 1), east-slope Cascades–Sierra Nevadas–Northern Rockies (cluster 2), and U.S. Rocky Mountains through southern Canadian (cluster 3) regions of the P. tremuloides range, with tree graph relationships of the form ((cluster 1, cluster 2), cluster 3). Populations consisted mainly of diploids (86%) but also small numbers of triploids (12%) and tetraploids (1%), and ploidy did not adversely affect our genetic inferences. The main vector of admixture was from cluster 3 into cluster 2, with the admixture zone trending northwest through the Rocky Mountains along a recognized phenotypic cline (Utah to Idaho). Clusters 1 and 2 provided strong support for the “stable-edge hypothesis” that unglaciated southwestern populations persisted in situ since the last glaciation. By contrast, despite a lack of clinal genetic variation, cluster 3 exhibited “trailing-edge” dynamics from niche suitability predictions signifying complete northward postglacial expansion. Results were also consistent with the “inland dispersal hypothesis” predicting postglacial assembly of Pacific Northwestern forest ecosystems, but rejected the hypothesis that Pacific-coastal populations were colonized during outburst flooding from glacial Lake Missoula. Overall, congruent patterns between our phylogeographic and ecological niche modeling results and fossil pollen data demonstrate complex mixtures of stable-edge, refugial locations, and postglacial expansion within P. tremuloides. These findings confirm and refine previous genetic studies, while strongly supporting a distinct Pacific-coastal genetic lineage of quaking aspen.","tags":null,"title":"Genotyping‐by‐sequencing and ecological niche modeling illuminate phylogeography, admixture, and Pleistocene range dynamics in quaking aspen ( {\u001bmph{Populus tremuloides}} )","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julio A.

Location The mountains of south-western China and adjacent mountains including Mts. Bashan, Dalou and Qinling also known as the sky islands in south-western China. Taxon The long-tailed mole (S. fusicaudus), a semi-fossorial mammal distributed in the sky islands of south-western China, is a relict species and the sole representative of the tribe Scaptonychini. Methods We sequenced one mitochondrial and six nuclear genes from 113 samples across the species’ range. We estimated phylogenetic relationships and divergence times, conducted genetic structuring and species delimitation using multiple approaches and used Approximate Bayesian Computation to test potential gene flow. We conducted ecological niche modelling to predict the species’ potential distribution in the present, the last glacial maximum and the last interglacial (LIG). Results The species comprises a minimum of 17 operational taxonomic units which are isolated in different mountain ranges. The lowlands and large rivers act as barriers to dispersal, and have isolated evolutionary lineages for up to 11 million years. Long-distance dispersal is evident among a few discrete montane archipelagos. Suitable climatic conditions during the LIG are limited to only a few sites, thus geographically restricting climatic stable areas across geological periods (from the LIG to the present). Main conclusions For low-vagility species, the complex topography of the sky islands has promoted exceptional diversification through a combination of eco-environmental stability as well as geographic fragmentation. The mountains have acted as a buffer against climate change, and have provided continuously suitable habitats for S. fusicaudus since the early Late Miocene, supporting the hypothesis that the sky islands constitute “museums” of ancient lineages.

We employed correlative modeling analyses to infer the geographic distribution of climatically suitable conditions for the species on climatic scenarios for the present and for years 2050 (average for 2041–2060) and 2070 (average for 2061–2080). The data consisted of species occurrences and 5 bioclimatic variables containing interpolated and averaged information on seasonal variation of temperature and precipitation. Models were projected onto climatic scenarios employing three different global circulation models and two representative concentration pathways. For each of these scenarios, we quantified the expected changes in area (km2) holding suitable climatic conditions and how much of that area is expected to be within the current Brazilian system of protected areas. Our results reveal that climate change represents a major threat for the survival of L. vetulus by drastically reducing its habitat availability in a period of time no longer than five decades from now. Experimental physiological and behavioral studies are necessary to assess whether L. vetulus is able to adequately tolerate under climatic conditions different to those under which the species is currently present.","tags":null,"title":"Climate change and its potential impact on the conservation of the Hoary Fox, {\u001bmph{Lycalopex vetulus}} (Mammalia: Canidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We provide an updated classification of current knowledge about breeding biology of Neotropical Accipitridae and define the taxa that should be prioritized by future studies. We analyzed 440 publications produced since 1995 that reported breeding of 56 species. Tere is a persistent scarcity, or complete absence, of information about the nests of eight species, and about breeding behavior of another ten. Among these species, the largest gap of breeding data refers to the former “Leucopternis” hawks. Although 66% of the 56 evaluated species had some improvement on knowledge about their breeding traits, research still focus disproportionately on a few regions and species, and the scarcity of breeding data on many South American Accipitridae persists. We noted that analysis of records from both a citizen science digital database and museum egg collections signifcantly increased breeding information on some species, relative to recent literature. We created four groups of priority species for breeding biology studies, based on knowledge gaps and threat categories at global level. Group I (great scarcity of information, plus higher categories of threat): Leptodon forbesi, Cryptoleucopteryx plumbea, and Buteogallus lacernulatus; Group II (breeding data have recently increased, but threat categories are high): Spizaetus isidori, Accipiter gundlachi, Buteogallus coronatus, Pseudastur occidentalis, and Buteo ventralis; Group III (“Near Treatened” species with still scarce breeding information): Accipiter poliogaster, Accipiter collaris, Buteogallus aequinoctialis, and Pseudastur polionotus; and Group IV (other priority cases): Buteo ridgwayi, Buteo galapagoensis, four eagles (Morphnus guianensis, Harpia harpyja, Spizaetus ornatus and Buteogallus solitarius), Leptodon cayanensis, Accipiter superciliosus, Buteogallus schistaceus, and the three Leucopternis hawks (L. semiplumbeus, L. melanops and L. kuhli).

It is thought to vary geographically as one of a set of correlated life-history traits that are under selection from varying ecological conditions. We completed a comprehensive literature review and calculated egg sizes for the most widespread clade within tyrant flycatchers, describing for the first time the geographical variation in egg size on a continental scale. We examined the relative support for ecological and environmental variables in explaining egg size variation using multi-model inference and linear mixed models controlled for phylogenetic autocorrelation among species. We tested five hypotheses and found that: larger eggs occur in colder sites, which is consistent with the embryonic temperature hypothesis; medium/long-distance migrants had smaller eggs than resident species while short-distance migrants had the largest eggs; neither species clutch size, nor species nest type, nor evapotranspiration seasonality influenced egg size. Avian egg size is larger in Austral and Neotropical America (ANA), where species are resident or short-distance migrants, and smaller across the medium/long-distance migrants of the Nearctic region. In addition, while clutch size increases towards higher northern latitudes and is almost invariable across ANA species, egg sizes vary largely across ANA sites, increasing with southern latitudes and higher elevations and being influenced by summer temperature. While the embryonic temperature hypothesis has been usually linked to parental nest attentiveness, we highlight that environmental temperatures also have strong effects in shaping investment in egg size.","tags":null,"title":"Ecological and environmental factors related to variation in egg size of New World flycatchers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neander M.

We performed a gap analysis with several basic life-history traits of New World flycatchers of the subfamily Fluvicolinae. We found breeding data - mostly on clutch sizes and linear egg measurements - in 303 publications spanning the years 1838 to 2012. Data from the USA and Argentina were more abundant, with the number of publications per country being significantly and positively related to human development index (HDI) and Fluvicolinae breeding species richness. The amount of available clutch size information for each species was positively related to species’ range size and relative abundance. More research is needed concerning narrowly distributed and uncommon species. Additional efforts to gather data on all Neotropical species are, however, crucial for future advancements.","tags":null,"title":"Breeding biology research and data availability for New World Flycatchers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.A. Marini","F.J.A.

With 196 nests of 42 species found from 2002 through 2009, we found that most species nested from September to November/December, at the onset of the rainy season, with extensive overlap among species. Contrary to expected for a tropical region, the breeding season period of most species was brief, and lasted 3–4 months. As expected for a tropical region, most species laid two eggs, but clutch sizes reached a maximum of six eggs in a few species. The strong seasonality of the Cerrado, with a rainy season of 7–8 months, is apparently the most important factor that limits breeding and other activities (ex. molt) in this region. Few studies like this are available for the Neotropical region, yet they are fundamental and are still needed and useful for the development of life history theory. Therefore, we recommend that breeding biology receives much more emphasis in future research than to date.","tags":null,"title":"Breeding biology of birds in the Cerrado of central Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel A Marini","Fabio J.

During the reproductive seasons of 2002 through 2009 we monitored 99 columbid nests, including Ruddy Ground-dove (Columbina talpacoti), Scaled Dove (C. squammata), Picazuro Pigeon (Patagioaenas picazuro), and Pale-vented Pigeon (P. cayennensis). Nests of Picazuro Pigeons (n = 60) were mostly within a reserve, at heights from 0.9 to 6.5 m and clutch size was usually one. On average, incubation period lasted 14 days and nestling period lasted 19.2 ± 7.4 days. Nests of Ruddy Ground-doves (n = 34) were mainly in the disturbed area at heights from 0.4 to 7.0 m and clutch size was one or two. Incubation period lasted 14 days and nestling period lasted 12.9 ± 2.4 days (mini- mum 10 and maximum 18 days). Nests of Scaled Doves (n = 3) were in the disturbed area, placed from 1.1 to 3.0 m and had two eggs or nestlings. Nests of Pale-vented Pigeons (n = 2) were at heights of 1.7 and 2.3 m in a palm swamp in the reserve interior and clutch size was one. The breeding patterns (e.g. nesting habitats, nest height, clutch size, incubation and nestling periods, egg color and measurements) found in this study are in accordance with those of columbids in general and other studies done with spe- cies from Central and South America.","tags":null,"title":"Breeding biology of Columbidae in central Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Curcino","Neander M.

Understanding different savanna habitats is fundamental to determine distribution of bird species, due to its heterogeneity. We studied richness, abundance and species composition in Mata da Barragem (MB), Pedra Verde (PV) and Morro Seco (MS), in the reserve of the Anglo-American Mining Company – CODEMIN, Niquelândia, Goias, Brazil. In six censuses during 2005-2006, 156 bird species were found in 46 families, and 106 species were counted in 90 samples and 850 contacts. Relative abundance varied from 0.011 (1 contact) to 0.422 (38 contacts). Areas PV and MS were most similar. In MB there was larger abundance of Emberizidae, while in PV Tyrannidae was more abundant and Thraupidae was in MS. Species with maximum occurrence and high relative abundance in a place were not the most frequent and abundant in the others, probably due the differences between available of resources.","tags":null,"title":"Comparação de três comunidades de aves na região de Niquelândia, GO","type":"publication"}]
