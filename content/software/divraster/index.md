summary: Alpha and beta calculations using rasters for taxonomic (TD), functional (FD), and phylogenetic (PD) dimensions. Spatial and temporal beta diversity can be partitioned into replacement and richness difference components. Functions to calculate standardized effect size for functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity and the average traits are available. ![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/divraster?color=green)

Randomization of presence/absence species distribution raster data for calculating standardized effect sizes and testing null hypothesis. The randomization algorithms are based on classical algorithms for matrices (Gotelli 2000, doi:10.2307/177478) implemented for raster data.
