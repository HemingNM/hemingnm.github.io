abstract = "Philohydor lictor is a Neotropical tyrant flycatcher that belongs to a Kiskadee-like mimetic system. This system encompasses seven genera with at least one species with strikingly similar plumage patterns, in which smaller species mimic larger species to deceive predators. The reproduction of P. lictor is poorly known and misidentification of its nests and eggs with other similar-plumage species may be common and creates confusion with its plumage-like species. Here, we aim to summarize the knowledge about its reproductive biology and highlight the common pitfalls in gathering information on mimetic species in citizen science, literature, and museum databases. We assembled 106 reproductive records between 1898â€“ 2023, of which 49 were from citizen science, 37 were from the literature, and 20 were from museum egg collections. Most reproductive records were from Panama (31.3%, N = 26) and Brazil (25.3%, N = 21). Egg-laying occurred mostly in the first half of the year and peaked when monthly total precipitation was between 150-300 mm (40%, N = 16). Nests were loose cups placed on vegetation near water and built with dry twigs, roots, and tendrils lined with fine twigs. Eggs from museum collections measured 20.9 x 16.1 mm (N = 23). Misidentified records comprised 21.7% (N = 23) of total breeding records and occurred mostly in museum egg collections. Misidentifications included records of domed nests, eggs larger than expected for the species' body size, and records from outside the species range. These results stress that studies with reproductive biology of mimetic species based on citizen science, literature, and museum datasets are not straightforward, and data should be refined by validation procedures. These validations should include verification of records inside the species' geographic range, correct description of nests, and egg size matching adult body size."
