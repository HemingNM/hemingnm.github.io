abstract = "The gray-headed tody-flycatcher Todirostrum poliocephalum is a passerine endemic to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We describe the nest and nesting behaviour of this species and investigate geographical variation in breeding traits in the genus using data from the literature, museum collections, and citizen science projects. We located 21 nests of the gray-headed tody-flycatcher, 13 of which we monitored. Nest height above the ground averaged 3.3 ± 3.4 m (n = 21). Nests were built over a 16.8 ± 5.6-day period (n = 6) by both adults. Clutch sizes ranged from two to three eggs, with a mean of 2.9 ± 0.3 eggs (n = 10). Eggs measured 16.6 ± 0.5 × 12.0 ± 0.5 mm (n = 23) and weighed 1.1 ± 0.1 g (n = 19). Mean incubation period was 17 days (n = 3) and mean nestling period was 15.5 days (n = 2). Apparent reproductive success was 30.8%, with predation being the primary cause of nest failure (46.1%). Mayfield’s reproductive success was 25.9%, and daily survival rates for eggs and nestlings were 0.957 and 0.971, respectively. Clutch sizes increased with latitude, but temperature and precipitation seasonality had very low importance in explaining clutch size variation."
