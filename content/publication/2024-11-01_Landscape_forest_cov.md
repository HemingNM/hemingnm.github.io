abstract = "Cacao is the most important agricultural product in the southern region of Bahia state, Brazil, with 70,% of its production occurring under the traditional agroforestry where cacao is mostly shaded by native trees. This traditional system allows to reconcile the production with the maintenance of the portion of original biodiversity. However, increased deforestation and intensified agroforestry management aimed at boosting productivity may impact the diversity of native species and the services they provide. In this context, our aim was to disentangle the role of landscape forest cover and the local vegetation complexity on predation of caterpillars and herbivory of cacao plants located in agroforestry systems. The study was conducted across 18 cacao agroforest sites in southern Bahia located in landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. We assessed predation rate using dummy caterpillars, sampling understory birds and arthropods and collected leaves of cacao trees to analyze damage by herbivory. We also measured shading levels and the abundance of cacao trees in each agroforestry. Predation pressure on dummy caterpillars was positively influenced by the abundance of total predators and the level of landscape forest cover and negatively by the number of cacao trees. Even so, we found no evidence that landscape, local features or the actual invertebrate assemblages (predators or herbivores) influenced the cacao leaf damage. The findings highlight the multifaceted interactions between ecological factors, predation pressure, and leaf damage within cacao agroforestry systems."
