abstract = "Introduction                                Theobroma cacao                 , the cocoa tree, is a target for pathogens, such as fungi from the genera                 Phytophthora                 ,                 Moniliophthora                 ,                 Colletotrichum                 ,                 Ceratocystis                 , among others. Some cacao pathogens are restricted to specific regions of the world, such as the                 Cacao swollen shoot virus                 (CSSV) in West African countries, while others are expanding geographically, such as                 Moniliophthora roreri                 in the Americas.                 M. roreri                 is one of the most threatening cacao pathogens since it directly attacks the cacao pods driving a significant reduction in production, and therefore economic losses. Despite its importance, the knowledge about the microenvironment of this pathogen and the cocoa pods is still poorly characterized.                                                        Methods                                Herein we performed RNA sequencing of spores in differential stages of culture in a medium supplemented with cacao pod extract and mycelium collected of the susceptible variety ICT 7121 naturally infected by the pathogen to evaluate the diversity and transcriptional activity of microorganisms associated with the                 in vitro                 sporulation of                 M. roreri                 .                                                        Results                                Our data revealed a great variety of fungi and bacteria associated with                 M. roreri                 , with an exceptional diversity of individuals from the genus                 Trichoderma                 sp. Interestingly, the dynamics of microorganisms from different kingdoms varied proportionally, suggesting they are somehow affected by                 M. roreri                 culture time. We also identified three sequences similar to viral genomes from the                 Narnaviridae                 family, posteriorly confirmed by phylogenetic analysis as members of the genus                 Narnavirus                 . Screening of                 M. roreri                 public datasets indicated the virus sequences circulating in samples from Ecuador, suggesting a wide spread of these elements. Of note, we did not identify traces of the viral sequences in the                 M. roreri                 genome or DNA sequencing, restricting the possibility of these sequences representing endogenized elements.                                                        Discussion                                To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of viruses infecting the fungus of the genus                 Moniliophthora                 and only the third description of viruses that are able to parasite elements from the                 Marasmiaceae                 family."
