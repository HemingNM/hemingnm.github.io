abstract = "The White-throated Kingbird (Tyrannus albogularis) is a widespread species in north-central South America, where it inhabits a variety of open to semi-open habitats. The breeding biology of the species is almost unknown. We describe the reproduction of the species based on 34 nests found in southeastern Brazil and eastern Bolivia since 2004, and eggs and nests found in museum collections. The breeding season lasts from mid-September to mid-February throughout its breeding range. The nest is cup shaped and supported from below. Nests were built with woody stems, grass stems, rootlets, and palm fibers. Mean clutch size was 2.3 eggs, which were ovoid with a pink ground coloration, covered by dark spots and blotches of variable size and color concentrated at the rounded end. The mean incubation period was 16.3 d and the nestling period was 18 d."
