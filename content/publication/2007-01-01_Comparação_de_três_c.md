abstract = "Comparison of three bird communities near Niquelândia, in the state of Goias. Understanding different savanna habitats is fundamental to determine distribution of bird species, due to its heterogeneity. We studied richness, abundance and species composition in Mata da Barragem (MB), Pedra Verde (PV) and Morro Seco (MS), in the reserve of the Anglo-American Mining Company – CODEMIN, Niquelândia, Goias, Brazil. In six censuses during 2005-2006, 156 bird species were found in 46 families, and 106 species were counted in 90 samples and 850 contacts. Relative abundance varied from 0.011 (1 contact) to 0.422 (38 contacts). Areas PV and MS were most similar. In MB there was larger abundance of Emberizidae, while in PV Tyrannidae was more abundant and Thraupidae was in MS. Species with maximum occurrence and high relative abundance in a place were not the most frequent and abundant in the others, probably due the differences between available of resources."
