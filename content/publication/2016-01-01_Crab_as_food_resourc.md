abstract = "The Snail Kite is considered a feeding specialist, eating Pomacea snails and eventually non-snail prey items. We monitored four feeding perches, used by a single kite, along a farming fence, in a flooded area in the Pantanal of Pocon√©. We found 39 empty shells of red freshwater crabs (Dilocarcinus pagei) and channeled applesnails (Pomacea canaliculata). Crab shells summed 77% of all items. We found the highest reported proportion of an alternative food item consumed. The median diameter of snails was 52.0 mm, ranging from 35.0 to 78.8 mm (N=7). Crab shell width averaged 41.7 mm, ranging from 23.7 to 49.1 mm (N=23). Medium sized (40 to 44 mm) crabs were the most frequent among all consumed items. The size of preyed snails is within the variation described in the literature."
